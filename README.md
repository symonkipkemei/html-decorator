<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">File Search</h1>

## brief
- Decorates user inputs into html language


## Task:
    ```
    Write a decorator function that wraps text passed to it in a specified HTML tag. The user should be able to decide which tag to use.

    For example, you should be able to use the decorator like so: You should be able to pass any HTML tag name to your decorator, irrespective of how many arguments the function that you're wrapping takes. The wrapped function should output their returned string wrapped in the relevant HTML tag: You can accomplish all this with just one decorator, but you'll need to apply all the concepts that you've learned throughout this section.

    This project can be challenging. Push yourself and attempt to complete it in order to synthesize your learning and apply your knowledge practically.
